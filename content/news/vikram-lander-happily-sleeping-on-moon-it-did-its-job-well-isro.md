ISRO chief S Somanath said Chandrayaan-3's Vikram lander is "happily sleeping" on Moon. "It [did] its job very well...If it wishes to wake up, let it wake up. Until then, we'll wait," he added. ISRO made efforts to re-establish connection with Pragyan rover and Vikram lander after they were put into sleep mode following the onset of night on Moon.
