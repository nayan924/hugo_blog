A Constitution bench of the Supreme Court on Tuesday refused to give legal recognition to same-sex marriages. The SC bench, headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) DY Chandrachud, pronounced the judgement on 21 pleas filed by same-sex couples, LGBTQ+ activists and organisations. The apex court had reserved its judgement on the matter on May 11.
