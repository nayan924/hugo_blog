DMK's Udhayanidhi Stalin has filed a counter affidavit in the Madras High Court challenging the petition filed against him by Hindu Munnani office bearers over his controversial remarks on Sanatana Dharma. Stalin told the court that the plea was filed against him due to ideological differences. The counsel representing Stalin argued that Article 25 of the Constitution gives people the right to practice and propagate atheism.
