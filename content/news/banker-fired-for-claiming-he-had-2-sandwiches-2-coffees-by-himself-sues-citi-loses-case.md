A former Citibank employee, fired for lying about eating two sandwiches, two pasta dishes and drinking two coffees by himself, has lost a wrongful dismissal case in the UK. The banker had initially claimed he alone had the meals during a business trip and sought expenses from Citibank. He was fired after he admitted that his partner shared some meals.
