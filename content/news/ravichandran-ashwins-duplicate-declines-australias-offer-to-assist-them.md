Mahesh Pithiya, dubbed as Ravichandran Ashwin's duplicate for having a similar bowling action, has declined Australia's offer to assist them in their preparations for the ODI World Cup 2023. "It is always exciting to work with international teams, but my priority is domestic cricket," he told Sportstar. Pithiya, who plays for Baroda, had helped Australia prepare against spin earlier this year.
